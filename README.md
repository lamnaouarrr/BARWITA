BARWITA is a comprehensive remote-controlled car project powered by a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. This project integrates motor control, camera streaming, 4G connectivity, and a web-based interface to enable seamless remote operation and real-time monitoring over the internet. Whether you're a hobbyist diving into robotics or an enthusiast expanding your IoT skills, BARWITA offers a hands-on guide to building and customizing your own internet-connected smart car.

## Introduction

BARWITA is designed to provide a comprehensive experience in building an advanced remote-controlled car with internet connectivity. Leveraging the power of the Raspberry Pi 4, this project encompasses hardware assembly, software development, network configuration, and web interface design. The goal is to create a robust platform that can be controlled remotely from anywhere in the world using 4G connectivity, with real-time camera streaming and vehicle telemetry.

The project follows a structured 12-week development roadmap, progressing from basic hardware assembly to advanced features like internet control, sensor integration, and a game-like web interface.
